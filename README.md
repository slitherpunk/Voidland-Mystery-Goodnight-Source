# Voidland-Mystery-Goodnight-Source
it's voidland from goodnight


oh hi


i made this last year as my first step into trying out godot
so i decided 2 post it on git hub in case you wanted to look at what i did
but honestly i didn't really know what i was doing i was just kind of
going my first try at godot so this is jank as heck
"but autumn it's just a little maze of images how can it be jank" 
buddy i made this at like nights of 1 or 2 am. i didn't have the time 2 look up better ways to do things.
i was falling asleep!!! 

idk what 2 license this as or what ever. just don't like idk. say u made my game? 
u can use this tho if u want to like. make something like it tho.
i used some other  script i got from that asset library. so i didn't make that part.
